## Reset DIWA
There are three options to reset DIWA's Database:

* Click on the bomb-icon on the bottom of the page to get to the Reset-Page. There you can trigger
  the database reset.
* When calling `/?reset=diwa` the database is being resetted instantly (unprompted).
* To also reset file changes and delete created files, just reset your git workspace (reset / clean).
  When using MySQL you should additionally use one of the reset methods above.
